        <h5>03/07/2019</h5>
        I long for a day on which I could close my eyes and picture the things which I hold to be beautiful. When I close my eyes I see nothing. Instead all I am left with is the constant chatter which is my consciousness. I am in a room full of people and they are all trying to speak to me at the same time. Each voice drowns out the last and so all I hear is an indecipherable cacophony of half heard syllables and cadences. I would not wish this kind of mental torture on my worst enemy.
        <br />
        <br /> I find myself sat on my own in a corner, frightened and lonely. My only solace comes from my Internal monologue which speaks so loud as to be heard over the crowd. This voice gives me respite from the confusing din that my mind produces. I would thank myself lucky to have access to this tool if not for fact that my internal monologue and I are at odds with one another. When I say 'I hate you Louis' I am not talking to myself, I'm talking to him. This leads to a question which has troubled me greatly in recent months. Which one am I? I am certain we are two seperate entities and yet I don't know if I am him or I am me.
